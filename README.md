# DATA CLEANING USING SQL
My first ever project on Data Cleaning Using SQL!

This project demonstrates the application of SQL techniques to clean and prepare raw datasets for analysis. It serves as a practical example of how to transform messy data into structured, reliable information using SQL.

## 👩‍💻 Project Overview

In this project, I focused on cleaning a raw dataset by addressing common data quality issues such as:

- Remove Duplicates
- Standarize the data
- Null values or blank values
- Remove the columns or rows

The goal was to prepare the dataset for further analysis, ensuring its integrity and reliability.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **SQL**: Utilized SQL queries for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **MySQL Workbench**: Executed SQL scripts and managed the database.
- **CSV Files**: Worked with CSV files for importing and exporting data.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `layoffs.csv`: Contains the raw and cleaned datasets in CSV format.
- `Data Cleaning Using SQL.sql`: SQL script file with all the queries used for data cleaning tasks.

## 🔍 Key SQL Techniques Used

- `SELECT DISTINCT` – To identify and remove duplicate records
- `IS NULL / IS NOT NULL` – For detecting and handling missing values
- `UPDATE` – To correct data inconsistencies
- `ALTER TABLE` – For modifying table structures when necessary
